# my_ecomProject
Prediction of Yearly Amount spent of a dataset for Ecommerce company based on features provided in a dataset using Linear Regression and Python.

We'll work with fake data from the Ecommerce Customers csv file from some company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. 

We will explore the dependencies between the numerical columns and the Yearly Amount spent and we will try to figure out does the company need to improve more their mobile app or the web application.

The software and libraries that need to be installed are listed in file 'requrements'.
